    STL(Standard Template Library)
    -> An STL is a library of generic functions and classes which saves you time and energy 
       which you would have spent constructing for your use. 
    -> STL is used because it is not a good idea to reinvent something which is already built and can be used to innovate things further.
    
    COMPONENTS OF STL:
    We have three components in STL:
        1. Containers
        2. Algorithm
        3. Iterators

    1. Containers:
    Container is an object which stores data. We have different containers having their own benefits. 
    These are the implemented template classes for our use, which can be used just by including this library.
    You can even customise these template classes.

    2. Algorithms:
    Algorithms are a set of instructions which manipulates the input data to arrive at some desired result. 
    In STL, we have already written algorithms, for example, to sort some data structure, or search some element in an array. 
    These algorithms use template functions. 

    3. Iterators:
    Iterators are objects which refer to an element in a container. And we handle them very much similarly to a pointer. 
    Their basic job is to connect algorithms to the container and play a vital role in manipulation of the data.
